# Training your first audio Transformer

Intro about music classification.

## The dataset

To train a Transformer to tell what type of music is playing, we'll need some song samples and their musical genres. We'll use the famous [GTZAN dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/marsyas/gtzan), which consists of 999 song samples across 10 different genres. The dataset is available on the Hugging Face Hub, so let's download it to get a sense for it contains:

```py
from datasets import load_dataset

gtzan = load_dataset("marsyas/gtzan", split="train")
gtzan
```

```py out
Dataset({
    features: ['file', 'audio', 'genre'],
    num_rows: 999
})
```

Notice that we specified a single split to download; that's because GTZAN doesn't have a predefined training and test split. We'll create our own splits for training and evaluation shortly. If we take a look at one of the examples, we can see that we're provided with a file path, an `audio` object, and the music genre:

```py
gtzan[0]
```

```py out
{'file': '~/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/7b31326ffc96eb5c1ad6dcbfc8187a6c4cc6efdfa3c7e42788fc7be8bba7a0a4/genres/blues/blues.00000.wav', 'audio': {'path': '~/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/7b31326ffc96eb5c1ad6dcbfc8187a6c4cc6efdfa3c7e42788fc7be8bba7a0a4/genres/blues/blues.00000.wav', 'array': array([ 0.00732422,  0.01660156,  0.00762939, ..., -0.05560303,
       -0.06106567, -0.06417847], dtype=float32), 'sampling_rate': 22050}, 'genre': 0}
 ```
